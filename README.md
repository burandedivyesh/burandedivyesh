# Hi, I'm Divyesh

I’m a curious and experimental engineer exploring machine learning and computational systems.

I enjoy understanding how things work at a deeper level — whether it’s a model’s behavior, an optimization process, or the performance characteristics of a system.

I’m motivated by questions like:
- Why does this approach work?
- What assumptions are we making?
- How does performance change under constraints?
- What happens if we build it from scratch?

## How I Approach Problems

- I prefer experimentation over intuition.
- I value clarity and structured thinking.
- I care about reproducibility and proper evaluation.
- I’m comfortable learning by building.

I see engineering as a process of exploration — test, measure, refine.

## Current Interests

- Machine learning systems
- Optimization techniques
- Performance analysis
- Clean experimental design
- Writing thoughtful, well-structured code

## Tools I Work With

Python, C/C++, Java, Rust  
PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn  
Linux, Git

I’m continuously learning and refining how I think about building intelligent systems.
